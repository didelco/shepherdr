# Herdr integration notes

Inspected on 2026-09-29 before implementation:

- [Herdr repository](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr): CLI dispatch, machine catalog serialization, machine target routing, snapshot collection, schema types and protocol guards.
- [Documentation overview](https://herdr.dev/docs/).
- [Socket API](https://herdr.dev/docs/socket-api/).
- [Connecting machines](https://herdr.dev/docs/connecting-machines/).
- [CLI reference](https://herdr.dev/docs/cli-reference/).
- [Agents](https://herdr.dev/docs/agents/).
- Installed Herdr 0.9.0: `api schema --json`, `api snapshot`, `status server --json`, `machine list --json`, and a read-only probe of `--machine` support.

Rechecked on 2026-10-01 with installed CLI 0.9.3: `--machine` is supported, and the unchanged Shepherdr probe successfully reads the existing local 0.9.0 server. Herdr reports that server as compatible with no restart required.

## Commands and envelopes

| Purpose | Invocation | Consumed shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Saved profiles | `herdr machine list --json` | Array of `id`, `label`, `target`, `session`, `enabled`; `selected` is irrelevant to routing |
| Local session | `herdr api snapshot` | `result.type == session_snapshot`, `result.snapshot` |
| Remote session | `herdr --machine <opaque-profile-id> api snapshot` | Same snapshot envelope, remote session chosen by Herdr |
| Diagnose older local socket failures | `herdr status server --json` | `running`, `compatible` |

Snapshot and catalog invocations use an executable URL and an argument array, without a shell. For snapshots, Herdr owns forwarding, saved session selection and protocol negotiation. The originally inspected 0.9.0 CLI rejects `--machine`; installed CLI 0.9.3 supports it. There is no fallback from a failed remote request to Local. Terminal streaming has a separate SSH adapter, described below. Neither path scrapes the TUI or parses human listings for application data.

API failures can be JSON on stderr with a nonzero exit status. Decode those envelopes first. Older CLI usage errors have exit status 2 without an envelope; these are reported as incompatible commands. Unstructured transport diagnostics are shown as details, not parsed into agent data. Remote authentication, install and bridge failures without a structured error remain actionable **Unreachable** states. Snapshot/catalog stdin is closed and SSH askpass is disabled.

## Snapshot mapping

The snapshot contains `version`, private `protocol`, `workspaces`, `tabs`, `panes`, `layouts`, and `agents`. Layout geometry and focus do not affect the overview and are ignored. Core consumed collections are required; omitted/malformed collections cannot erase last-known data. Additional fields are ignored.

Only the `agents` array creates agent rows. Join its `workspace_id`, `tab_id` and `pane_id` to the corresponding records. Identity is `(machine ID, terminal_id)`, retaining all routing IDs for future actions. Names are optional: use `name`, then `display_agent`/`agent`. Preserve reported semantic `agent_status`; display-only labels, titles and metadata must not override it. Unknown future state strings map to **Unknown** and remain visible in the inspector. Workspace labels are distinct from filesystem paths. Prefer an agent's foreground directory, pane foreground directory, reported cwd, then worktree checkout information.

Herdr owns agent detection and lifecycle authority. Shepherdr does not infer agent progress from screen contents, timing, process names or shell output. In particular, idle does not imply completion, and a custom summary does not imply blocked. The snapshot's explicit done state is shown as Done. New completion sequence fields are not used to invent local unread-completion state.

JSON compatibility is based on the response contract, not a hard-coded private binary protocol number. Herdr's CLI may itself enforce CLI/server compatibility and emit `protocol_mismatch`; Shepherdr surfaces that error. A newer server with additional fields or states can remain usable.

## Refresh and events

The inspected CLI exposes snapshot/schema commands but no general event-stream wrapper. `events.subscribe` requires a persistent raw socket connection; `agent.wait` is targeted coordination, not a cluster subscription. v0 therefore uses bounded periodic CLI snapshots and manual refresh, without a helper daemon or plugin.

A future socket transport must subscribe and receive acknowledgement **before** taking the bootstrap snapshot, buffer events during bootstrap, then reconcile them in order. It must resnapshot on reconnect and apply workspace/tab/pane/agent lifecycle updates. Do not assume that subscriptions replay earlier events. Expose changes to the store through the client boundary; SwiftUI should remain transport-independent.

Queries run concurrently, each with a 12-second process deadline and an 8 MB output bound. Both output pipes drain off the main actor. Cancellation kills the child-owned process group when available, and terminates the child otherwise. The store publishes each response as it arrives. Catalog failure retains known profiles, successful discovery removes deleted profiles, disabled profiles are not queried, and failed snapshots retain their last data and timestamp. Refreshes do not overlap. The refresh interval starts after the prior refresh completes, so unavailable remotes can lengthen a whole cluster cycle by up to the command deadline; manual refresh is disabled during that cycle. `RefreshSchedule` decides what each tick asks. While Shepherdr is on screen, every machine is due at the user's interval. Off screen (the window occluded, the displays asleep, the screen locked, or the user session inactive), the local machine keeps that interval and remote ones are asked every 30 seconds. `machine list --json` runs about once a minute, and on the next tick after it failed. A manual refresh, a change to the machines, waking, or coming back on screen asks everything at once. A machine the catalog brings that wasn't enabled before is asked right away.

## Deliberate limits

- Local is the default session. Remote profiles each identify one session.
- No cluster event subscriptions; terminal windows do consume live CLI frame streams.
- No persistence of cached session data across launches.
- No server lifecycle management. Shepherdr creates workspaces, closes panes and changes saved machines only when you ask; enabled terminal input and resizing affect the selected existing terminal through Herdr's API. The [agent tools](AGENT-TOOLS.md) also prompt agents with the handoffs their sessions receive, and Compass starts, prompts and replaces its own agent in its own workspace.
- Actual multi-host SSH validation needs configured machines; automated tests exercise multiple synthetic machines and failures through the same store/client boundary.

## Existing terminals (0.2)

Inspected again on 2026-10-03 using Herdr CLI 0.9.3, its `terminal session` help, the public `src/client/terminal_sessions.rs` implementation and an isolated 0.9.3 server. The reference client [herdrm](https://github.com/missuo/herdrm) demonstrates daemon-owned terminals with native rendering; its current code uses Ghostty, while its README also mentions an earlier SwiftTerm implementation. Shepherdr uses its own adapter and SwiftTerm 1.10.1's AppKit renderer. No Herdr or herdrm implementation is copied.

Local connections explicitly target the saved session and stable terminal ID:

```sh
herdr --session default terminal session observe TERMINAL_ID --cols 100 --rows 30
herdr --session default terminal session control TERMINAL_ID --cols 100 --rows 30
```

Both commands stream newline-delimited JSON: `terminal.frame` includes `encoding: ansi`, `width`, `height`, `full` and base64 `bytes`; `terminal.closed` includes a reason. Control accepts `terminal.input` with base64 bytes, `terminal.resize`, `terminal.scroll` and `terminal.mouse` on stdin. Herdr encodes a `terminal.mouse` event for the program's mouse mode and drops it when the program hasn't enabled mouse reporting; frames never carry the program's input modes, so Shepherdr can't tell which programs read the mouse. Herdr before 0.9.2 doesn't know `terminal.mouse`: it notes the unknown command on stderr and keeps the stream. Observation is read-only and cannot resize through stdin, so changing its viewport reopens that observer connection. Shepherdr never passes `--takeover`. Closing the window releases its client connection, not the server or shell.

`herdr --machine PROFILE terminal session control …` is explicitly rejected as not API-backed by CLI 0.9.3. For remote streams, the transport therefore launches `/usr/bin/ssh -T` with the saved target, then invokes the remote installed Herdr executable with the same session/terminal arguments. A fixed POSIX script locates Herdr; every variable argument is quoted independently, including the outer `sh -c` command. Tests execute adversarial quoted values as literal arguments. User terminal input travels as JSON on stdin and is never interpolated into the SSH command. There is no remote PTY, install/bootstrap, password prompt, host-key bypass, or agent forwarding. Existing OpenSSH configuration and authentication apply.

Every SSH call Shepherdr makes itself shares one option list (`SSHOptions`): `-T`, `BatchMode=yes`, `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`, `ConnectTimeout=10`, `ClearAllForwardings=yes`, `ForwardAgent=no`, and `ServerAliveInterval=10` with `ServerAliveCountMax=2`. Commands (folder checks, clones, load and background-work readings, agent tools, mail, dropped files) add `ControlMaster=auto`, `ControlPath` in `$HOME/.shepherdr/ssh/%C`, quoted and with `%` escaped, and `ControlPersist=60`, so they share a connection per machine, as Herdr's `--machine` calls do with their own. The folder is made `0700` at launch and used only while it is a private directory of the user's, not a link; ssh fails outright when it is missing. `%C` is a 40-character hash and ssh first binds the socket under a 17-character temporary suffix, so a folder path over 45 bytes, under a very long home, goes without sharing. A backgrounded master hands its standard streams to `/dev/null`, so a command's pipes still reach EOF when it ends. Terminal streams pass `ControlMaster=no` and `ControlPath=none` instead, overriding any sharing in the user's own configuration: killing a shared client leaves its remote command running with the master holding its pipes, and ending a stream must end `terminal session control` and release the terminal.

`HerdrTerminalClient` and `HerdrTerminalConnection` carry domain frames/input independently of the renderer. `TerminalStore` owns observation/control state, input ordering, resize debounce and reconnect. Each connection drains stdout/stderr asynchronously, requires an initial frame within 15 seconds, bounds records to 4 MB, diagnostics to 16 KB, pending writes to 1 MB, and buffered frames to eight. Backpressure fails visibly rather than silently discarding ANSI deltas. Reconnect starts with Herdr's fresh full frame. After a dropped connection, `TerminalStore` reconnects on its own under a `ReconnectPolicy`: waits that double from 1 second to 5 minutes, for up to an hour, on `SuspendingClock` so time asleep doesn't count. It doesn't retry a terminal Herdr reports as not found, an incompatible failure, or another client's control: that still falls back to observing. A terminal nobody can see for 30 seconds (the window occluded or minimized, the screens asleep, locked or switched to another user) rests: `TerminalStore.setVisible` detaches it on purpose, with no reconnect pending, and attaches it again in the same mode when it shows, keeping the last frame until Herdr's full one arrives. Resource scans wait for the window to show. No terminal contents are logged or persisted by Shepherdr.

The window supports keyboard input, paste, text selection and copying, scrolling through Herdr's history, and plain clicks for programs that read the mouse; dragging always selects natively. Terminal escape sequences cannot write to the system clipboard through OSC 52. Clicked links are restricted to HTTP(S).

Pane IDs such as `w3:p1` are numbered per Herdr server, so the same one exists on several machines; terminal IDs look like `term_65de5e979051a2` in 0.9.3. `SessionDirectory` turns either, or a session's agent or workspace name, written in a terminal into a link to that session: a pane ID on the session's own machine, unless `@machine` or a `--machine PROFILE` option on the same line names another, which only this Mac's Herdr profiles can. Agents Herdr didn't name report their program's name, such as `Claude Code`, which Shepherdr never takes for a session's name.

## Agent tools (0.9)

Checked on 2026-10-15 with Herdr 0.9.3 in disposable sessions. The [agent tools](AGENT-TOOLS.md) use these parts of Herdr:

- **Doorbells.** `herdr pane report-metadata <pane> --source shepherdr --token shepherdr-mail=<id>` sets a token that the snapshot reports in `panes[].tokens`, on shell panes too, and in `agents[].tokens`. The same source can rewrite it any number of times. Values are cut at 80 characters and names must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}`. Tokens follow the terminal across agent start, release and replacement and `pane move`; a server restart drops them, and changes terminal IDs too. Shepherdr reads only well-formed letter IDs from them.
- **Holds.** Shepherdr copies each waiting session's holds into tokens on its pane: `shepherdr-waits`, then `shepherdr-waits-2` up to `-6` when they don't fit in 80 characters. Each hold is its phase's letter (`p` pending, `s` started, `f` finished) and the awaited terminal ID, with `@<machine ID>` when it is on another machine, comma-separated: `sterm_65e3751a172063,fterm_65e3751a2a7e74@remote:buildbox`. Checked on 2026-10-19 with Herdr 0.9.3: tokens from the same source add up rather than replace each other, `--clear-token` removes one and clearing a missing one is no error, one report sets or clears at most 16 tokens, and a pane keeps at most 32 from all sources, refusing the whole report past that. The copy on this Mac is the one Shepherdr writes; it reads the tokens back only for a waiting session it has no record of and hasn't changed since Herdr last showed it.
- **Caller context.** Herdr gives every pane `HERDR_ENV`, `HERDR_PANE_ID` and `HERDR_BIN_PATH`. `herdr pane current --current` answers with the caller's `terminal_id` and, when an agent runs there, its `agent` label. The API records no parent for a pane, so links come from what `shepherdr` writes, never from guesses.
- **Creating sessions.** `workspace create --cwd … --label … --no-focus` answers with `.result.root_pane`, and `pane split <pane> --direction right|down --cwd … --no-focus` with `.result.pane`. Both name the new pane's `pane_id`, `terminal_id` and `workspace_id` once in compact JSON, so the command reads them with a fixed pattern instead of parsing JSON in sh. Herdr expands `~` in `--cwd` on its own machine, and opens a missing folder's workspace in the home folder without an error, so the command checks local folders first.
- **Shells.** A pane without an agent reports `agent_status: unknown`, and its `revision` doesn't change with its output. `pane process-info --pane <pane>` answers with `shell_pid` and `foreground_processes`: just the shell while it waits at its prompt, the command otherwise. Shepherdr reads it only for shells that a session waits for, while that hold hasn't finished, and compares `pane read` output to notice a command that finished between two looks.
- **Worktrees.** `worktree open --cwd <repository> --branch <branch> --label … --no-focus` opens the branch's existing worktree, answering like `workspace create` plus `already_open: true` when a workspace already has it, or fails with `worktree_not_found`. `worktree create --cwd … --branch … [--base <ref>] --label … --no-focus` checks an existing local branch out, or creates the branch from `--base` or the repository's `HEAD`, under `<worktrees.directory>/<repo>/<branch-slug>` (`~/.herdr/worktrees` by default), and opens the repository's own workspace too when it isn't open. Git's refusals, such as a branch already checked out elsewhere, come back as `worktree_create_failed` with Git's message; a folder outside a repository as `not_git_worktree`. Remote `--cwd` paths must be absolute or start with `~`. New Session uses both, and fetches a pull request's commits itself first, with plain Git over the same SSH connection as its folder check.
- **Agents.** `agent start <name> --kind <kind> --pane <pane> --timeout 60000` returns once the agent is ready, or `agent_not_ready` when it stopped at a startup question. Names must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}`; the timeout must be over 3,000 ms and at most 300,000 ms. `agent prompt <pane> <text>` takes a text starting with `-` as text; it fails with `agent_not_ready` when the agent isn't the pane's foreground process, and refuses one that shows a question.
- **Other machines.** All of these go through `--machine <profile>`, which Herdr forwards over its own SSH connection. Errors are JSON on stderr, `{"error":{"code":…,"message":…}}`.

`Tests/AgentTools/herdr-live.sh` checks the command against a real Herdr in a server of its own, and CI runs it with Herdr from Homebrew.

## Compass (0.9)

Checked on 2026-10-15 with Herdr 0.9.3 in a server of its own, in a scratch home, with a stand-in `claude` that reports itself with `pane report-agent`:

- **Its workspace.** `workspace create --cwd ~/.shepherdr/compass --label compass --no-focus`, then `agent start compass --kind <kind> --pane <pane> --timeout 60000` in its root pane, so a failed start leaves a pane Shepherdr can start the agent in again. A name another agent has fails with `agent_name_taken`; Shepherdr then starts it as `compass-<4 hex>`. Herdr reports pane folders with symbolic links resolved (`/tmp` as `/private/tmp`), so Shepherdr compares resolved paths.
- **Finding it again.** Shepherdr keeps the terminal ID it started. After a Herdr restart, which changes terminal IDs, it looks for a pane whose workspace starts with `compass` and whose folder is Compass's. Before the local machine's first snapshot, it doesn't start anything: only Herdr's answer tells whether the agent is there.
- **Runs.** `agent prompt <pane> <text>` once the agent is `idle` or `done`, as handoffs are delivered. `agent_blocked`, `agent_not_ready` and `agent_busy` are tried again later.
- **A new day.** `pane close` on every pane in Compass's workspace and folder, then a new workspace. Closing a workspace's only pane closes the workspace.
- **Awake and online.** Shepherdr runs `agent start` and `agent prompt` for Compass only while this Mac is fully awake and online (see [AGENT-TOOLS](AGENT-TOOLS.md#runs)): Herdr types the agent's plain command, such as `claude`, into the pane's shell, so the moment is the only difference from starting it by hand. An agent started across a sleep or a lost network is replaced before its first prompt as on a new day: `pane close`, then a new workspace and `agent start`.
