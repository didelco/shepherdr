# Shepherdr guide

A native macOS console for the coding agents running in your [Herdr](https://herdr.dev/) workspaces, locally and over SSH.

The sidebar is your prioritized queue of sessions. Pick one and its live terminal opens in the work area, with a composer underneath for the next prompt. Shepherdr is an independent, open-source client; it is not an official Herdr application and is not affiliated with the Herdr project.

## Features

- **Session queue:** every agent session in your own priority order, shown by workspace, what the agent is doing, and where it works: its folder, or for a Git worktree its project, in cyan. When a session has a pull request among its resources, its number is there too, or how many it has; click it to open the session with the pull request in its browser, or the ten most relevant in tabs. An agent that isn't working but left commands running, such as a dev server or a watcher, shows a turning clock **◴** instead of its state's mark. Drag to reorder, use the ▲▼ controls, **⌥⌘↑ / ⌥⌘↓**, or jump with **⌘1…⌘9**. Gather sessions into **groups** that you prioritize like a single session, each with its own internal order.
- **Work area:** the selected session's live terminal, embedded in the main window like Herdr's own client. Switching sessions detaches the previous one; the pane keeps running in Herdr.
- **Type in the terminal:** work in the agent's own TUI; **⇧⏎** adds a line instead of sending. Drop files or images on it to paste their paths, so Claude Code and Codex attach them. A bottom bar has quick keys (Esc, ^C, Tab, arrows, Return).
- **Optional prompt editor:** open it (**⌘L**) for long prompts you want to think through and edit with the mouse. **⏎** sends, **⇧⏎** adds a line, **↑/↓** recall this session's prompts.
- **Dictation:** record a prompt (**⇧⌘D**); it is transcribed on this Mac and lands in the prompt editor for you to review.
- **Unlocked by default:** sessions open with input enabled. Click the padlock to lock one read-only. If another client controls the terminal, Shepherdr stays locked and offers an explicit **Take Over**.
- **A browser per session:** click a link in the terminal and it opens in the session's own browser, next to the terminal; its tabs stay put while you work elsewhere. **⌘-click**, in the terminal or in a page, opens your default browser instead.
- **Resources:** the pull requests, issues and Claude artifacts a session links to gather in a panel on the right, one click from its browser.
- **Local files:** click a path an agent prints. Markdown opens rendered in the session's browser, HTML opens as a page, and any other file in its default app.
- **Click to choose:** click an option of an agent's numbered menu, such as a permission prompt, to select it; double-click to confirm.
- **Picks up where you left off:** after a restart, the session you had open comes back, and every session keeps its browser tabs, prompt editor and resources.
- **Notifications:** a macOS notification tells you when an agent finishes or needs you, with what it last said, and when a pull request's checks finish. Click it to open the session.
- **Sessions on hold:** mark a session as waiting for others, such as a planner waiting for the subagents it launched. It shows an hourglass, and the sessions it waits for are listed under it, in a tree you can collapse.
- **Create and close sessions:** **⌘N** creates a Herdr workspace with a shell in a folder; start Claude Code, Codex or any other supported agent in it and it joins the queue. Create one in a group with its **+**, or next to a session with **New Session in Same Folder…**. **Close Session…** in a session's context menu ends its pane after confirmation. **Rename…** renames its Herdr workspace.
- **Overview:** how many sessions need you, are working, done or idle, and a card per machine with its sessions and its processor, memory and disk use. Click states and machines to list the sessions in any combination of them. Plain shell panes are listed separately.
- **Lid status:** the foot of the sidebar tells you whether it's safe to close the lid. While agents work on this Mac it warns you not to, since sleep would pause them; remote sessions don't count, they keep going.
- **Machines** in **Settings → Machines** (⌘,): add SSH machines, disable them to stop polling, or remove them from Herdr's catalog.
- Concurrent queries, independent connection states, and last-known data marked stale after failure.
- Automatic refresh (5, 15, 30 or 60 seconds), pause, manual refresh with **⌘R**, and refresh after wake.
- A dark phosphor console theme in [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (bundled), any installed monospaced font for the terminal, an 8-bit logo of a German Shepherd watching its flock, and a pixel-art app icon of a German Shepherd in Matrix digital rain.

No worktree management, notifications, or menu-bar UI. Input goes only to the session you are viewing, while it is unlocked; creating, closing and machine changes happen only when you ask, and closing asks for confirmation.

## Download and install

Download the `.dmg` from [the latest GitHub release](../../../releases/latest), open it, and drag **Shepherdr.app** to **Applications**. A `.zip` of the same app and SHA-256 checksums are also available. Requires **Apple Silicon (M1 or later) and macOS 14 Sonoma or later**; no Xcode is needed to run the download.

Current downloads have an **ad hoc signature and are not notarized by Apple**. If macOS blocks the first launch because the developer cannot be verified and you trust this download, use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** for Shepherdr. Follow [Apple's instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445); managed Macs may require administrator approval.

Install and start Herdr separately, then open Shepherdr. The app reads your existing sessions and saved machines. Installing the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) and signing in with `gh auth login` is recommended: see the requirements below.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later.
- A locally installed `herdr` supporting `machine list --json` and `api snapshot`.
- For remote machines, a local Herdr build with the documented global `--machine` option, plus compatible remote installations and an already-running server. Herdr CLI 0.9.3 provides that option; 0.9.0 does not. Shepherdr shows an incompatibility message on older CLIs.
- For interactive terminals, the Herdr installation on the target machine must support `terminal session observe` and `terminal session control`. Verified with CLI/server 0.9.3. Remote terminals require a Unix-like host, OpenSSH access and an existing saved profile.
- Recommended: the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) on this Mac, signed in with `gh auth login`. With it, Shepherdr confirms GitHub pull requests and issues, private ones included, fetches their titles, and watches pull requests' CI checks. Without it, resources are checked through the session browsers, which see private repositories only while you're signed in there, and checks aren't watched.

Local integration has been verified with CLI 0.9.3 querying an existing, compatible 0.9.0 server. Updating the CLI does not require replacing a compatible running server.

## Connect Herdr

Start Herdr normally on your Mac. Shepherdr queries the **local default session** and lists the agents that Herdr itself reports. A shell pane is not an agent: panes without one appear under **Shells**, or in their group when created there, and move into the queue as soon as Herdr detects an agent in them. Machine status and failure details are in **Settings → Machines**.

Configure SSH machines in Herdr, then refresh Shepherdr:

```sh
herdr machine add workbox --label "Build machine"
# A saved profile can target a named remote session:
herdr machine add lab --label "Lab" --remote-session agents
herdr machine list --json
```

One profile represents one session, not every session on its host. Disabled profiles remain visible and are not polled. You can also add, disable, enable and remove machines in **Settings → Machines**; Shepherdr runs the same `herdr machine` commands. Adding a machine lets Herdr prepare its remote server, which can install or start Herdr there. Shepherdr never prompts for credentials: SSH must authenticate without interaction, so load passphrase-protected keys into your SSH agent first, or run the displayed `herdr machine add` command in Terminal. Removing a machine only forgets its profile; its remote server and sessions keep running. Shepherdr never stops or restarts a Herdr server.

Shepherdr locates Herdr in `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, then absolute entries in `PATH`. For a custom installation, set `SHEPHERDR_HERDR_PATH` to the absolute executable path in **Scheme → Run → Arguments → Environment Variables**, or launch the built app's executable with that variable:

```sh
SHEPHERDR_HERDR_PATH=/absolute/path/to/herdr \
  build/Build/Products/Debug/Shepherdr.app/Contents/MacOS/Shepherdr
```

Local executable discovery does not source shell startup files. Inherited `HERDR_SESSION`, `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`, and pane/workspace/tab routing variables are cleared so opening Shepherdr from an agent pane cannot silently retarget Local. Herdr's own configuration environment is otherwise retained.

## Overview

**⌘0** shows the overview. Its first row counts the sessions that need you, are working, are done or are idle. The second has a card per machine with how many sessions it has and how busy it is, to help choose where the next agent goes: processor use over one second, memory in use, and the disk holding the home folder, amber from 70% and red from 90%.

Click a state or a machine to show only its sessions, and click more to add them: the sessions that need you on two machines, say. Each row counts what the other row lets through. Click a card again to drop it, or **SHOW ALL** to see every session again. The sidebar's queue is never filtered. A machine that isn't answering shows its sessions' last known state, so they are left out once you choose a state.

Herdr does not report machine load, so Shepherdr measures it every 15 seconds while the overview is on screen: on this Mac directly, and on other machines with a short `sh` script over SSH, with the same non-interactive settings as remote terminals. The script uses `/proc` on Linux, `iostat` and `vm_stat` on macOS, and `df` on both. Memory in use counts what `free` and Activity Monitor count. A machine that stops answering keeps its last reading for a minute.

## Commands left running

Agents often leave commands running after their turn: dev servers, watchers, test loops. When the agent is done or idle, a turning clock **◴** replaces its ✓ or ○ in the queue, on its overview card and in its session's header. The first command shows next to the session's folder, with **+n** when there are more, also while the agent waits for you. Its help lists them all, with how long each has been running.

Agents run each command in a shell of their own, so Shepherdr counts the shells still alive under an agent that is not working: shells the agent started, not ones you open inside its pane, and only after five seconds, so its hooks and status line don't count. Herdr only reports a pane's foreground processes, so Shepherdr asks Herdr once for each pane's shell and lists the processes under them every 10 seconds while its window shows: with `ps` on this Mac, and on other machines over SSH, which returns only the processes under those panes.

## Prioritize sessions

The sidebar queue is your saved order across all machines; its numbers are each session's priority. Drag a session to a new position (a line shows where it will land), use the ▲▼ controls that appear on hover or selection, press **⌥⌘↑ / ⌥⌘↓** for the selected session, or choose **Move to Top/Bottom** from its context menu. **⌘1…⌘9** open the first nine sessions, **⌘[ / ⌘]** step through them and **⌘0** returns to the overview.

Ordering is saved on this Mac and restored when you reopen Shepherdr. Newly discovered sessions join the end. Refreshes, lifecycle changes, temporary disconnections and an incomplete machine catalog do not erase existing positions. Priorities follow the machine profile and terminal ID, so sessions with identical names on different machines stay independent. A newly created terminal has a new identity and joins the end.

### Groups

Groups gather sessions however you like: a project, a client, personal work. Create one with **+ group** in the queue header, **Session → New Group…**, or **Move to Group → New Group…** in a session's context menu; a group created from a session takes its place in the queue.

- A group is one position in the queue: drag its header, use its ▲▼ controls or its context menu to prioritize it like a session. Inside, its sessions keep their own order with the same controls.
- Drop a session on a group's header to add it, or between grouped sessions to place it exactly. **Move to Group** and **Remove from Group** in a session's context menu do the same without dragging. Groups do not nest.
- Click a header to collapse or expand the group. A collapsed group still shows how many of its sessions need you, and its sessions are skipped by **⌘1…⌘9**. Filtering shows matching sessions even inside collapsed groups.
- Hover a header and click **+** (or use **New Session in Group…** in its context menu) to create a session in the group. Until you start an agent in it, it is listed in the group as a shell.
- **Rename…** and **Ungroup** are in the header's context menu. Ungrouping leaves the sessions where the group was, in their order; it never closes them.

Numbers run through the whole queue, groups included, so they always reflect overall priority.

You can reorder while filtering the queue (**⌘F**): movement is relative to the visible sessions, and hidden sessions retain their saved slots, so a filtered list can have gaps in its numbers. Only stable identifiers, their order, and group names and collapse state are stored in the app's local preferences. Priorities are independent of Herdr state and are not synchronized between Macs.

## Create and close sessions

**⌘N** (or **+** in the sidebar) opens **New Session**: choose a folder (on the selected machine) and an optional name. Shepherdr runs `herdr workspace create --cwd … --label …` and opens its shell. Start an agent there as you would in any terminal: Herdr detects it, and the session joins the queue within one refresh.

Below the folder, the folders agents on the selected machine work in are one click away, the most used first. Git worktrees are left out: they belong to the session that made them.

Shepherdr checks the folder on its machine first, over SSH for other machines, where `~` means that machine's home and a relative path starts there. If it doesn't exist, New Session offers to start a new project there: **NEW PROJECT** makes the folder, runs `git init` in it and opens the session. Herdr itself would open a missing folder's workspace in the home folder without a word.

On this Mac, **CHOOSE…** always starts in your projects folder, `~/projects` unless you change it in **Settings → General**, and a folder name alone means a folder inside it. **New Session in Same Folder…** in a session's or shell's context menu prefills its folder and machine and places the new session right after it, in the same group. A group header's **+** places it in that group.

**Close Session…** in a session's context menu asks for confirmation, then runs `herdr pane close`. It is deliberately only in the context menu, away from everyday controls. This ends the agent process. When it is the workspace's last pane, Herdr closes the workspace too.

## Work with a session

1. Select a session in the queue or an overview card. Its terminal opens in the work area with keyboard focus, unlocked: the open padlock in the header means your input goes to the session.
2. Type in the terminal as you would in any terminal. **⇧⏎** sends Esc-Return, which Claude Code, Codex and Gemini read as a new line, so it no longer submits the first line of a multi-line prompt.
3. For longer prompts, open the prompt editor with **✎ PROMPT** in the bottom bar or **⌘L**. It is closed by default and keeps its draft while closed (the button shows a •). **⏎** or **SEND** sends the prompt as a bracketed paste followed by a separate Return, so agents receive it verbatim, then closes the editor and returns to the terminal.
4. Click the padlock (or press **⌘E**) to lock the session read-only; click it again to unlock. A locked session's editor still takes drafts. **⌘⎋** sends Escape, which interrupts most agents.
5. Click a web link in the terminal to open it in the session's browser, or **⌘-click** it to open your default browser. Paths to files on this Mac work too, absolute, under `~` or relative to the session's folder: Markdown opens rendered in the session's browser, HTML as a page, and other files in their default app (**⌘-click** always uses the default app). Links agents mark up explicitly and plain-text `http(s)://` URLs both work, including URLs that wrap across lines; the pointer turns into a hand over them.
6. Drop files or images on the terminal to paste their paths into the agent's prompt, escaped as other macOS terminals do; Claude Code and Codex attach dropped images. An image dragged without a file, from a web page say, is saved as a PNG first. In a session on another machine, Shepherdr first copies each file there over SSH, into `~/.cache/shepherdr/drops` (readable only by you, cleared after a week), and pastes that path instead. The session must be unlocked.
7. Click an option of an agent's numbered menu, such as Claude Code's or Codex's permission prompts, to move the selection there; double-click it to confirm. Shepherdr presses the arrow keys and Return for you, so it works with any agent that draws a numbered menu with a marker on the selected option. Other plain clicks go to the program if it reads the mouse: in Claude Code's full-screen mode (`/tui fullscreen`), clicking a word of the prompt moves the cursor there. Herdr 0.9.2 or later delivers them and drops them for programs that don't read the mouse, such as Claude Code's default mode or a shell.
8. To have one agent message another, use the session's Herdr pane ID, shown in the header as **pane w3:p1**: click it to copy it, or right-click it (or the session in the queue) for **Copy Reference for Agents**. That copies the pane ID with the command an agent runs to prompt it, `herdr agent prompt w3:p1 "<message>"`, ready to paste into a prompt such as "report your progress to the coordinator (…)". Agents in the same Herdr session can run it as is.
9. Selecting another session, quitting Shepherdr or pressing ↻ only detaches this client. Herdr keeps the pane and its process running.

Shepherdr never takes input away from another client implicitly. If one is attached, the session stays locked with a notice; **Take Over** is an explicit choice that uses Herdr's `--takeover`. If another client later takes over, Shepherdr locks the session again. Terminal resizing uses Herdr's supported viewport/resize messages. Scrolling with the trackpad or mouse wheel moves through the history Herdr keeps for the terminal (in a full-screen program such as `less`, Herdr scrolls the program instead); while you read earlier output, **↓ LATEST** takes you back, and so does typing. Herdr scrolls a terminal for every client at once and only for the one in control, so a locked session doesn't scroll. Dragging always selects text natively, even in programs that read the mouse. Selecting text with the mouse copies it; while the button is down, new output waits so the selection holds still. **Option** types what your keyboard layout gives it (such as **⌥2** for @ on a Spanish keyboard), as in Terminal; **⌥←/⌥→**, **⌥⌫** and **⌥⏎** still send the Meta sequences TUIs and shells use to move by word, delete a word and add a line. **⌘←/⌘→** go to the start and end of the line and **⌘⌫/⌘⌦** delete to them, as in macOS text fields: Shepherdr sends Control-A, Control-E, Control-U and Control-K, which agents and shells read. Drafts and prompt history are kept in memory per session and are never written to disk.

### Browser

Each session has its own browser column, to the right of the terminal. Clicking a link opens it there in a new tab, or switches to the tab already showing it; **◫ BROWSER** in the bottom bar or **⌘B** shows or hides the column, and **+** opens an empty tab. The tabs stay loaded, scrolled and signed in while you switch sessions, so a pull request you are reviewing is still where you left it. Pages that open new windows open new tabs. **⧉** opens the current page in your default browser.

**⌘-click** a link in a page to open it in your default browser instead.

Sign-ins are shared by every session's browser and persist across launches, in WebKit's own storage for Shepherdr. Safari's sessions and cookies cannot be shared with other apps, so sign in once here, or **⌘-click** links to use Safari. Shepherdr remembers each session's tabs, the selected one and whether the browser was open: after a restart they come back, and each page loads the first time you look at it. Closing a tab forgets it, and closing the session forgets them all.

Local Markdown is rendered with GitHub-flavored Markdown (tables, task lists), with its images, and without running any script it contains; **↻** renders the file again. Links between local files open the same way. HTML files open as pages that can read their own folder.

### Resources

The **RESOURCES** panel, to the right, collects the pull requests and issues (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Linear, Jira) and Claude artifacts a session links to. Each kind lists the ten most relevant first, the ones you open most and the ones mentioned most, then the newest; **more** shows the rest. GitHub numbers pull requests and issues together and redirects one kind of link to the other, so a number appears once.

Each new resource is checked once: links agents write as examples point nowhere. If the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) is installed and signed in, Shepherdr asks GitHub about its pull requests and issues, private ones included; anything else it loads out of sight in the session browsers, with their sign-ins. Resources that don't exist leave the panel, and the rest show their page's title. A page that asks you to sign in is checked again on a later launch, after you sign in through the session's browser.

**Pull request checks.** While you look at a session, and if the GitHub CLI is installed and signed in, Shepherdr watches the CI checks of its open GitHub pull requests: one query for all of them, every 15 seconds while checks run and every 2 minutes once they're done, paused while the Mac sleeps or the screen is locked. A mark follows each pull request in the panel and in the queue: ● running, ✓ passed, ✗ failed (as soon as one fails). When an agent finishes a turn, its session's pull requests are checked once more, since it may have pushed. When a pull request's checks finish, a notification says whether they passed or how many failed; click it to open the session with the pull request. Shepherdr finds them in the terminal while you watch it, in Herdr's recent output when you open the session, and in what an agent printed when it stops. Click one to open it in the session's browser; its context menu opens it in your default browser, copies the link or removes it. **≡ RESOURCES** in the bottom bar hides or shows the panel, which appears once a session has a resource. Resources are remembered with the session's tabs.

### Dictation

**🎙 DICTATE** in the bottom bar, or **⇧⌘D**, starts recording right away and opens the prompt editor. Press **STOP** (or **⇧⌘D** again) and the transcript is added to the draft for you to read and edit before sending; **×** discards the recording. Transcription runs on this Mac with NVIDIA's [Parakeet TDT v3](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3) through [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio), the same engine as [scribe](https://github.com/theam/scribe). It detects the language among 25 European ones, and handles English technical terms inside Spanish speech well.

The model is about 460 MB. The first time, Shepherdr asks before downloading it from Hugging Face; if scribe already downloaded it, Shepherdr reuses that copy. It loads into memory while you speak the first time after each launch. Your voice is kept in memory only while recording and never leaves the Mac. Shepherdr asks for microphone access the first time you dictate.

## Notifications

When an agent stops working, because it finished or because it needs you (a permission prompt, a question), Shepherdr posts a macOS notification with the session's name, its state and agent, and the first paragraph of the agent's last message, read from its terminal; when there is none, Herdr's summary of the session. Click a notification to open the session. The session you are looking at in the front window never notifies, and agents that go idle don't either. Shepherdr notices state changes when it refreshes the queue (**Settings → General → Refresh sessions**), so a notification can take that long to arrive; while refreshing is paused, none arrive.

macOS asks for permission the first time one is due. Turn them off in **Settings → General → Notifications**, or change their style in **System Settings → Notifications → Shepherdr**.

## Sessions on hold

When one session has to wait for others, such as a planner that launched subagents, choose **Wait For** in its context menu and tick the sessions it waits for. The session shows an hourglass in the queue instead of its state: blue while any of them is still working or needs you, green once they have all finished.

The sessions it waits for move under it in the queue, joined by tree lines, and move with it. Click **▾** with their count to hide them and **▸** to show them again; while hidden, the count turns amber if one of them needs you. A session waited for by several others is listed under the first of them. Filtering shows matching sessions even when hidden. To take one out of the tree, choose **Stop … Waiting for This** in its context menu.

In the tree, the sessions it waits for don't show their priority number: they follow the session waiting for them.

Opening a session on hold shows a panel above its terminal with the sessions it waits for and their state. Click one to open it, **×** to stop waiting for it, **+** to add more, or **RESUME** to take the session off hold. Sessions that others are waiting for list them under **WAITED ON BY**. Holds are saved on this Mac with your priorities and only contain session identifiers. Closing a session from Shepherdr removes its holds.

The interface uses the bundled Fira Code. **Settings → General → Terminal font** chooses the font and size for the terminal and prompt editor from the monospaced families installed on this Mac. **Ligatures**, off by default, join characters such as `->` and `!=` into single symbols in fonts that have them, like Fira Code; busy terminals redraw more slowly with them.

For remote terminals, Shepherdr invokes the remote installed Herdr CLI through `/usr/bin/ssh` using the saved profile's target and session. Host keys must already be trusted and authentication must work without a prompt. It uses the host's `herdr` on PATH, then checks `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin` and `~/.cargo/bin`. Connection or compatibility failures appear in the work area and leave the rest of the app usable.
