# Verification

## Agents wait for a fully awake Mac (unreleased)

Validated on 2026-10-20 on an Apple Silicon MacBook with macOS 26.6.2, Xcode 27 / Swift 6.4 and Herdr 0.9.3:

- **The cause.** On 19 and 20 October, Compass's agent started inside dark wakes of about two seconds, which `pmset -g log` lists as `DarkWake … [CDNP]`, without graphics or audio; the full wake that followed reads `[CDNVAP]`. Fully awake, `System Capabilities` in `IOPMrootDomain` reads 15, graphics included.
- `swift test`: **258 tests in 52 suites passed**, and `xcodebuild … build` built the app. New tests in `ReadinessTests` cover a dark wake, which is never ready; a sleep notice, which holds until the wake, or for a minute when macOS reports graphics; a wake, after which the host is looked up again and answers asked before it are ignored; a missing path and a host that doesn't resolve, with retries after 10 seconds, fresh answers for a minute and a new lookup on a new network; and sleeps and lost networks as disruptions. `AgentStartupTests` cover the first prompt waiting 15 seconds, and an agent started across a sleep or a lost network starting again: never once you typed to it, at most twice, and not for a disruption from before it began.
- **The monitor**, in a separate harness compiled in Swift 6 mode from the same `ReadinessMonitor` and `Readiness` sources, which posts `NSWorkspace`'s sleep and wake notifications in its own process. All 14 checks passed: the path answered; the first check looked `api.anthropic.com` up, told the handlers and then allowed agents; a sleep notice held every agent and counted as a disruption; the wake allowed agents with no host at once and looked the host up again; the screens waking ended a sleep too; `untilReady` waited while asleep and returned after the wake.
- **End to end, in a scratch home**, as for Compass below: a Herdr server of its own (`HOME=/tmp/shep-wake`), a stand-in `claude` that reports itself with `pane report-agent` and writes the day's page, and a copy of the app with its own bundle identifier, launched with `open -g` at 12:42:51. The 12:00 run, the day's first, was due. The monitor logged a path, then `api.anthropic.com` being looked up, then agents allowed 6 ms later. The agent started at 12:42:53 and was ready at 12:42:56; the prompt came at 12:43:13, the 15 seconds plus the next refresh. The page changed and the run ended `updated`, with its copy `days/2026-10-20/12-00.html`. The user's `default` session and app were never touched.
- Not verified: a real dark wake, which can't be caused without putting the Mac to sleep, and a sleep or a lost network while the app starts an agent. The restart before the first prompt is covered by the tests and the harness only. The Courier's waits (deliveries to agents on this Mac, sessions requested on it) were checked by reading the code only.

## Compass (unreleased)

Validated on 2026-10-15 on Apple Silicon with Xcode 27 / Swift 6.4 and Herdr 0.9.3:

- `swift test` — **173 tests in 35 suites passed**, plus the agent tools' 9; `xcodebuild … test` passed, building the app. New tests cover run times, missed runs (the Mac asleep from 10:20 to 14:40, a daily run missed in the morning, a Friday run not made up on Saturday, a run missed at 18:00 made up at 21:00), lenient settings written by an agent, the page's actions and the values they refuse, the kit by owner (an update rewrites the contract and leaves your prompt and your template alone), copies per run, marks, and `startAgent` with `agent_not_ready` and `agent_name_taken`. With Git installed, a folder is committed, pushed to a bare remote and restored from it.
- **End to end, in a scratch home.** A Herdr server of its own (`HOME=/tmp/shep-e2e/home`), a stand-in `claude` on its `PATH` that reports itself with `pane report-agent` and answers each run by writing the day's page, and a copy of the app with its own bundle identifier, launched with `open -g` against that server. The user's `default` session was never touched.
  - Launched at 21:17 with an empty `compass.json`, Compass prepared its folder, made up the 18:00 run once (kind `first`), started its agent in a `compass` workspace, sent the prompt when the agent was idle, saw the page change, kept `days/2026-10-15/18-00.html` and committed the folder. `context/run.json` and `context/sessions.json` read as documented; the queue's only other session was there, Compass's agent wasn't.
  - **Run Compass Now**, pressed through the menu bar with accessibility, sent an `update` with "Since 21:17" and left a second copy and commit.
  - In Agents, the queue, the overview and the shells listed only the other session. In Compass, the column, the page in its pinned tab, the agent's terminal and the live state badge on the page's `data-session` rendered as intended (window captures).
  - With yesterday's runs and agent in `state.json`, the next launch closed the old agent's panes, started a fresh agent named `compass`, and ran the day's first run. A first attempt showed two bugs, now fixed and checked again the same way: deciding before Herdr's first answer that there was no agent, and an agent left as a shell when the name `compass` was taken.
  - A `backup` remote written to `compass.json` by hand, as the agent would, was configured on the next check and pushed the whole history to a bare repository.
- **The page's bridge**, in a separate offscreen web view with the same script and world: a click made through the web view passed the spawn button's fields on; a page script's `click()` was ignored; page scripts saw neither the handler nor the bridge; decorations marked a session's state, a done item and a started session.
- Not verified: a real Claude Code or Codex run (the trust question and permissions in `.claude/settings.json`), clicking the page's buttons inside the app and the New Session sheet they open, Settings → Compass, the welcome screen and restoring from it, the notification when the agent needs you, and the warning for a public GitHub remote. Background launches kept the window from rendering in later captures.

## Session console redesign (0.4.0)

Validated on 2026-10-04 on Apple Silicon with Xcode 27 / Swift 6.4:

- `swift test` and the README's `xcodebuild … test` command — **45 tests in 6 suites passed**, including the native application build. The built bundle contains `AppIcon.icns` and `CFBundleIconName = AppIcon`.
- New tests cover drag-and-drop offsets within filtered queues, the explicit `--takeover` flag, prompt encoding (bracketed paste, escape stripping, separate Return), prompt submission order, conflict fallback to watching, user takeover, and returning to watching when another client takes over.
- A separate Herdr 0.9.3 session (`--session shptest`) held demo workspaces running a small mock agent, with lifecycle states set through `pane report-agent`. A wrapper routed a SwiftPM build of the app to that session; the user's default session was never connected to. A temporary in-process harness (not committed) drove the UI and rendered window images:
  - Overview counts and cards, sidebar queue with states, shells section, Settings → General and Settings → Machines rendered as intended.
  - Selecting a session embedded its live terminal in the work area in LIVE mode. A single-line prompt typed into the composer and submitted with Return arrived as one line in the agent (`pane read` confirmed).
  - A multi-line prompt submitted to a zsh pane ran both lines, confirming bracketed paste plus a separate Return against a real bracketed-paste consumer.
  - With another control client attached, opening that session fell back to WATCH, showed the conflict notice and offered TAKE OVER. A CLI check confirmed Herdr's `--takeover` gives the new client frames and closes the old one with `terminal attach taken over`.
  - Moving a session to the top and down one place from the sidebar updated the saved ranking; filtering kept movement relative to visible rows.
- Creating and closing (same day, later): 51 tests pass. New tests cover the exact `workspace create` / `agent start` / `pane close` / `machine add|enable|disable|remove` arguments, remote `--machine` routing, `agent_not_ready` as a waiting agent, option-like values rejected before running Herdr, preserved SSH diagnostics, and store refresh after a change. Against the isolated session, Herdr 0.9.3 behaviour was checked first: `workspace create` returns the root pane and terminal; `agent start --kind claude` resolves the real agent executable and reports `agent_not_ready` while Claude Code asks to trust the folder (that test agent was closed immediately, without a prompt); `pane close` on a workspace's only pane also closes the workspace. Through the app, a shell-only session was created, opened in the work area, then closed; the queue and shells list updated. The New Session sheet, Fira Code interface and terminal, font settings (monospaced families only) and the logo and app icon (later redrawn as a German Shepherd watching the flock, and a German Shepherd in Matrix sunglasses) were inspected in rendered images. Adding, disabling and removing machines were not run against a real SSH host, to avoid changing the user's Herdr catalog.
- Not verified: prompts against a real Claude Code (or other) agent, keyboard shortcuts delivered through real key events, drag gestures with a pointer, and remote SSH terminals. Screenshots of the real screen were unavailable; images were rendered in-process.

## Session priorities (0.3.0)

Validated on 2026-10-03:

- `swift test` and the README's Xcode test command — **40 tests in 6 suites passed**, including the native application build.
- Five new tests cover relaunch persistence, identical terminal IDs on different machines, late arrivals, missing sessions, filtered movement, boundaries, invalid preferences, duplicate identifiers, and aggregation through a mock Herdr client during failures and recovery.
- A disposable app copy with a separate bundle identifier and synthetic local/remote machines displayed eight sessions with priorities. Via native accessibility automation, selecting the last remote session and clicking **Raise Priority** moved it from position 8 to 7; **⌥⌘↑** then moved it to 6. Selection and the enabled/disabled movement controls updated correctly.
- Sorting by State kept saved priority numbers and disabled movement; sorting Priority ascending restored **My order** and its controls. In the remote machine view, moving that session to its first visible slot changed its global priority to 5 and disabled further upward movement. Returning to All Agents confirmed that the four hidden local sessions retained positions 1–4.
- The GUI launch was slow and screenshot capture was unavailable. These checks verified accessibility state and control behavior; they do not claim a screenshot-based layout review. Preference reload and hidden-slot preservation were verified by automated tests.
- This feature's GUI tests use a fixture executable, not the user's Herdr installation or active sessions.

## Interactive terminals (0.2.0)

Validated on 2026-10-03 on the same Apple Silicon host with Xcode 27 / Swift 6.4:

- `swift test` and the README's `xcodebuild … test` command — **35 tests in 5 suites passed**, including the native application build.
- Terminal tests cover structured frames and binary input, malformed frames, explicit local routing, safe quoting of SSH arguments, no forced takeover, shell panes without agents, streaming subprocess input/output, startup timeout, connection failure, observation/input isolation, mode changes, detach and reconnect.
- A separate real Herdr 0.9.3 instance used temporary configuration/state and a newly created test workspace. A disposable app copy displayed its workspace and the live shell prompt in a native **Observing** window.
- A live harness using the actual `CLIHerdrClient` attached in control mode, sent a shell command, detached and reattached twice. It verified the same terminal ID and shell PID on both passes. The running shell survived each client disconnect.
- Release packaging — **passed**: optimized arm64 build, ZIP extraction/signature check, bundled SwiftTerm license comparison, DMG verification and SHA-256 checksums.
- The user's normal local server and active remote sessions were not changed. No authenticated remote terminal was available. SSH quoting and failure behavior are tested locally; real multi-host terminal transport remains unverified.
- Automated GUI access became unavailable after verifying observation. Enabling input through the button and typing through the native view still need a manual end-to-end check; input/detach/reconnect are verified through the real transport and mocked store.

## Dashboard (0.1.0)

Validated on 2026-09-30 on macOS 26.6.2 (Apple Silicon), using Xcode 27.0 / Swift 6.4. Deployment target is macOS 14; an actual macOS 14 runtime has not been tested.

## Automated and live checks

- `xcodebuild -project Shepherdr.xcodeproj -scheme Shepherdr -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test` — **passed**, building the native application and running 27 tests in 3 suites.
- `swift test` — **passed**, the same 27 tests.
- `shepherdr-probe` against the real local installation — **passed**: executable discovered, Herdr 0.9.0 / protocol 22 decoded, one real workspace, no detected agents at verification time.
- Repeated the live probe on 2026-10-01 after updating the CLI to 0.9.3 — **passed** against the existing 0.9.0 server. Structured server status reported `compatible: true` and `restart_needed: false`; no server restart or session changes were performed.
- Xcode scheme XML, project plist and synthetic JSON fixtures — valid.
- Multiple machines, same IDs across machines, partial failures, recovery and stale retention — covered by the mock-client tests. No saved remote machine was available for real SSH verification.

## UI verification

The built native application was opened and inspected interactively:

- **Real installation:** All Agents showed Local as online and the expected empty agent state. Selecting Local displayed its actual workspace, directory, tab and pane counts, Herdr version and default session.
- **Synthetic cluster:** a separate disposable app copy used `SHEPHERDR_HERDR_PATH` to query an isolated fixture executable. Local and a remote profile supplied agents; another profile reported Herdr not running; a disabled profile stayed visible. No real Herdr configuration was changed.
- **Navigation and inspection:** checked All Agents, machine selection, workspace filtering, search by machine, the Blocked filter, and the metadata inspector. Machine/workspace ownership and routing identifiers matched the fixtures. Blocked agents appeared first with restrained orange emphasis.
- **Partial failure:** after a remote became unreachable, its four cached agents remained visible and marked stale while Local continued updating. The machine view exposed the error and last-received timestamp; summary counts excluded stale data.
- **Refresh and recovery:** pausing automatic refresh preserved the displayed snapshot. Manual refresh then recovered the remote and replaced cached rows, clearing stale markers.
- **Scale and layout:** checked 60 aggregate agents across two reachable machines, including unknown and future lifecycle values displayed as Unknown. Inspected a roughly 900 × 550 window with the inspector open: native horizontal table scrolling and vertical inspector scrolling kept content accessible.

The synthetic cluster validates application behavior, not a real SSH connection. No saved remote machine or real running coding agent was available during the initial verification. The updated CLI 0.9.3 supports `--machine`; real multi-host forwarding still needs successful SSH authentication and a saved profile targeting an existing remote session.
