# Developing Shepherdr

Requires macOS 14 or later and Xcode 16 or later, with its license accepted and first-launch components installed. See [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the ground rules.

## Dependencies

The native terminal renderer uses [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm), pinned to 1.10.1 (MIT). Fira Code 6.2 is bundled under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (`Sources/ShepherdrTerminalUI/Resources/Fonts`). This AppKit version builds without an additional Metal compiler component or binary framework. SwiftPM also resolves SwiftTerm's command-line tooling dependency, ArgumentParser; it is not linked into Shepherdr.

Dictation uses [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio), pinned to 0.13.4 (Apache 2.0), the engine and version [scribe](https://github.com/theam/scribe) uses, so both share one downloaded model. It has no further dependencies or binary frameworks. NVIDIA's Parakeet TDT v3 model (CC BY 4.0) is not bundled: FluidAudio downloads it from Hugging Face into `~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio` on first use. FluidAudio's license ships in the app. Microphone access needs the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key and, under the hardened runtime, the `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` entitlement in `App/Shepherdr.entitlements`, which the release script signs with. A `swift run` build has no Info.plist, so dictation reports that it is unavailable there instead of starting.

No API keys, accounts, or server-side Shepherdr service are required.

## Build and run

From this repository's root:

```sh
open Shepherdr.xcodeproj
```

Choose the shared **Shepherdr** scheme and **My Mac** destination, then press **⌘R**. No development team is needed for a local build. The application intentionally does not use App Sandbox: it must launch the user's installed Herdr executable and access Herdr's socket and SSH environment.

Or build and launch the application from Terminal:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Shepherdr.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Shepherdr -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
open build/Build/Products/Debug/Shepherdr.app
```

If Xcode requests setup, open Xcode once to install its components. Review and accept Apple's license with `sudo xcodebuild -license`. If the wrong developer directory is selected, use `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.

Swift Package Manager also builds the application executable:

```sh
swift build --product shepherdr
swift run shepherdr
```

Use the Xcode-built `.app` for normal Dock/Finder use. See [releasing](RELEASING.md) for the automated Apple Silicon packages and their signing status.

## Tests and diagnostics

```sh
swift test
xcodebuild -project Shepherdr.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Shepherdr -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test
# Read-only live transport/store smoke test; exits 1 when no machine is online:
swift run shepherdr-probe
# The agent tools' command line, against a fake herdr and then a real one in a server of its own:
sh Tests/AgentTools/test.sh
sh Tests/AgentTools/herdr-live.sh
```

The agent tools' command line is a POSIX `sh` script that runs on Linux too: check changes to it with dash or BusyBox (`docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/src -w /src alpine sh Tests/AgentTools/test.sh`) and ShellCheck, as CI does. Bump `Sources/ShepherdrCore/Resources/AgentTools/VERSION` whenever you change the kit, so machines update. See [agent tools](AGENT-TOOLS.md).

The updater (`Sources/ShepherdrCore/Resources/Updater/update.sh`) is checked by the Swift tests against a release made on the spot, signed ad hoc, which it must refuse. Its happy path needs a Developer ID release: `SHEPHERDR_LIVE_UPDATE_TEST=1 swift test --filter LiveUpdateTests` installs the published 0.8.6 over 0.8.5 in a scratch folder, without opening it. Add `--check-only` to the script to download and check a release without replacing anything. Local builds have no team, so their **Update** offers stay off.

Tests use Swift Testing, synthetic JSON fixtures, mock cluster/terminal clients, isolated preferences, an injected command runner, and bounded real subprocess tests. They cover decoding, domain joins, all states, future states, duplicate IDs, aggregation, partial failures, stale retention, recovery, catalog failures, disabled/removed profiles, incremental results, cancellation, literal arguments, pipe draining, terminal JSON streams, observation/input boundaries, detach/reconnect, priority persistence and filtered reordering. No running Herdr or SSH access is needed for the test suite.

Use **Settings → Machines** for failure details. A malformed response is **Incompatible**, never a successful empty session. Temporary failures keep cached rows visible with a stale marker and last-received timestamp. The summary counts exclude stale rows. Last-known snapshots are held in memory only; quitting clears them. The app does not collect telemetry or write snapshot/terminal contents to disk; saved priorities contain only session identifiers.

scripts/make-artwork.sh            Regenerates the icon, README header and social preview (see Artwork)
scripts/pixelate.swift             Turns art into strict pixel art in App/Theme.swift's palette
scripts/make-icon.swift            Renders App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset from docs/assets/icon.png
scripts/make-header-masks.py       Prepares the header's masks and cleaned art (Python, rarely needed)
```

Compass's pure parts are in Core and tested there: `CompassSchedule` (run times and missed runs, with fixed clocks), `CompassConfig` (lenient, since agents edit it), `CompassAction` (the page's buttons), `CompassFolder` (the kit and the files by owner), `CompassRepository` (Git, tested with a real Git and a bare remote when Git is installed), and `Readiness` and `AgentStartup` (when an agent may start or get its first prompt, with fixed clocks). `CompassController` in the app follows the agent through each run; `ReadinessMonitor` feeds `Readiness` from macOS.

`HerdrClient` exposes domain snapshots and the machine catalog. `HerdrTerminalClient` exposes live terminal connections, frames and input. `CLIHerdrClient` implements both; views never execute commands or decode JSON. Agent identity combines the machine profile and terminal ID, so identical pane IDs and names on different machines remain distinct. Native Unix-socket transport and event subscriptions can replace the CLI behind these boundaries.

See [integration notes](HERDR-INTEGRATION.md) for the inspected contract, compatibility policy, event strategy and limitations.

## Artwork

The app icon, the README header and the social preview are strict pixel art: every art pixel is a square of the same size, in a color from `App/Theme.swift`. `scripts/pixelate.swift` reads every hex color in that file, divides an image into a grid, averages each cell in linear light and picks the theme color nearest in CIE L\*a\*b\*. `Theme.artworkShades` adds in-between shades that only the artwork uses.

```sh
bash scripts/make-artwork.sh
```

regenerates everything from `docs/assets/source`:

- **Icon:** `source/icon.png` becomes 206×206 art pixels (`docs/assets/icon.png`). That fills the macOS icon grid's 824-point body exactly, 4 pixels per art pixel at 1024 and 1 at 256, so `make-icon.swift` keeps hard edges down to 256 and smooths only the smaller sizes.
- **Header:** 480×270 art pixels at 3 px, shown 720 points wide in the README, so each art pixel is exactly 3 pixels on Retina screens. Sheep, title and code stay in the phosphor greens. Regions recolor the dog into the logo's amber shepherd and the tongue into the terminal's pinks, matched by lightness, and turn the glowing outlines into single lines, brown around the dog and green elsewhere. Lone high-contrast flecks inside the dog are cleaned, and `touchups.txt` holds hand edits in art pixels, such as the fangs.
- **Social preview:** the header at 2 px on a 1280×640 canvas. Upload `docs/assets/social-preview.png` in the repository's **Settings → General → Social preview**.

The header's masks and `clean.png`, the original with the code digits erased from the dog's coat, come from `scripts/make-header-masks.py` and are committed. Rerun it (it needs Pillow and NumPy) only after changing the hand-placed regions in `docs/assets/source/header/regions.json`: the dog's outline, eyes, tongue, the title's ascender between the paws and the columns of digits, in the original's pixels.
